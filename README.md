## 5.20.19
V 1.0
Sitewide
- Major design updates to try and make everything cleaner & more intuitive. Also resulted in cleaner code which will be easier to update going forward. Major changes to the Landing Page, Topic Page, Admin Panel, and Topic Edit Page.

Known issues:
- Top navigation bar links not working yet
- Untested on smaller screen sizes & other browsers
- Landing Page: 
    - Intro/header text ("This site is designed to facilitate...") not currently editable
    - Current Conversation: The topic summary ("Most servers and bartenders...") is currently hard-coded text. If you change the featured topic, this text won't update. Will fix.
- Topic Page:
    - Common Ground: Currently formatted to only display plaintext. Will update so that it's able to, at the very least, show line breaks and/or bullet points.
    - Discussion Arena: 
        - Like & Comment functionality currently disable. Will re-enable
        - If one key claim is active, still have to click twice on another key claim to change the display stream. Will fix
        - Temporarily disabled the feature that changes URL's to clickable links. Looking into a change that will give the admin more control over basic text formatting, i.e. making links clickable, paragraph breaks, bold/italic/etc.
- Admin Panel
    - Temporarily removed "Register New Admin" button, will add back in.
    - Add New Topic functionality also temporarily removed, will add back in
    - Edit Topic Page:
        - Discussion Arena still not fully functional. Will add support for 'Add Key Claim' & ability to re-order Key claims. Also will add ability to edit discussion stream & re-order.
